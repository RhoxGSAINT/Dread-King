unit_description_historical_texts_text_Dread_King	The being known as the Dread King was known to have been one of Nagash's most powerful followers, aiding him in his early attempts to bring undeath to the world. He served Nagash well and was rewarded with an aura of dread and a mighty undead Dragon. Not much is known about him before he became a servant of Nagash, but he was probably not one of the former Priest Kings. His armies fight in the fashion of the ancient civilizations from the southern parts of the Old World. Scholars assume that the Dread King set out from the Black Peninsula to conquer the then fertile lands around the Mortis Delta. His dynasty lasted for many years, but the Priest Kings naturally could not tolerate a foreign invader and waged a long war against him. When Nagash rose to power the Dread King saw an opportunity to defeat his foes and secure his kingdom, even if it meant being merely a vassal of the great necromancer. At some point, however, after the fall of Nagash, he was killed and buried in a pyramid in Nehekhara. Thousands of years later, the Dread King would return to plague the world once more. His awakening triggered a shockwave of necromantic power, one that caused the dead to rise from graves and tombs across the Old World. Many other mighty beings joined the ranks of the Dread King, including another Dark Lord, the Hand of Nagash, and the devastatingly powerful Black Grail Knights.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_hand_of_nagash	One of Nagash's most powerful arch servants, and also one of his original Dark Lords, was a Necromancer of no name. Serving the will of Nagash in all things, the nameless one rode across darkened lands, and terror rode with him. In time, the nameless one was given a name by those who feared his coming, the ‘Hand of Nagash’. The Hand of Nagash was eventually defeated, and his body was imprisoned within a massive glacier located on the border between Troll Country and the Chaos Wastes. Countless centuries after his defeat, the Undead forces of his fellow Dark Lord, the Dread King, successfully managed to free the Hand from his icy prison. Mounted atop a fell chariot pulled by Skeletal Steeds, the Hand of Nagash terrorizes the lands once more.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_dread_larenscheld	Gunther Larenscheld was once a great wizard of the Celestial college at Altdorf, delving into the secrets of the future, scrying out the course of things to be and reading texts hidden from humanity for centuries. During his research Larenscheld came across the Grimoire Necris, an ancient tome written by the necromancer Van Damneg, an alias used by the Dread King to hide its true origin. As he read the volume, one of many written by the dark sorcerer during his life, Larenscheld heard whispers of conquest and greatness. His demeanor became more bleak and he lost all interest in his other work. As he experimented in secret Larenscheld’s power grew. From the humble beginnings of reviving recently killed insects, he progressed through small mammals and managed to reincarnate the life force within a human corpse. Gunther Larenscheld was discovered breaking into the sealed vault within the Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf, attempting to steal the books of Nagash and the Liber Mortis. Knowing that he could no longer practice his arts within the civilized confines of the Empire, Larenscheld shriveled his foes with winds of death and fled. Larenscheld has searched long for the resting place of the Dread King, baneful servant of Nagash. He sought to restore this awful entity to his full strength once more, gaining unlimited riches and authority through the power of the Dread King. Eternal life is the aim of Larenscheld, and the Dread King may be able to help him avoid the clutches of death. To achieve this end, the necromancer will risk anything, stopping at nothing until his grim lord is once more in dominion over all he surveys.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_liche_general	The undead legions of the Dread King are led by hand-picked generals. Every single one of them is a foul liche and powerful necromancer. As such, they grow their armies after every battle they win, making the Legions of Terror even more unstoppable. With the experience of millennia, they can read any battlefield and are never outwitted by the enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_dread_centurion	From among his retainers, the most loyal and battle-hardened were raised to the rank of Hetairoi. They formed the elite guard of the Dread King and served as commanders of the Royal Guard. Even in undeath, they are still as loyal to him. These mighty warriors march at the head of the legions and subdue anyone who stands in their lord's way. Whether dead or alive, in the end they all serve the Dread King.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_skeleton_javelinmen	The Skeleton Javelinmen are lightly armoured skirmishers. They carry a small amount of javelins and small crescent-shaped shields. After harassing the enemy by flinging javelins, they hastily retreat before any counter-charge or flanking move can be carried out. This, of course, is not out of fear, a feeling they no longer know, but because they must make room for the phalanxes to close in. The weakened enemy is then swiftly crushed by an impenetrable wall of spears.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_skeleton_hoplites	These undead soldiers form the bulk of the Legions of Terror. They fight in the manner of the ancient civilization of the Black Peninsula. Equipped with huge round shields and spears, dressed in weathered bronze armor, they form tight formations in battle that are difficult to overcome. In battle, they march forward unflinchingly, tirelessly thrusting their spears into their enemies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_skeleton_pikemen	These Phalangites fight in the modern way of their time, with long pikes that have evolved over the centuries from spears. Nowadays this is considered ancient warfare, but a solid wall of pikes is still tremendously difficult to overcome. All the more so when the phalanx is made up of fearless and tireless skeletons that advance unstoppably towards their enemies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_mummies	Mummies, also known as the Preserved Dead, are made from the corpses of ancient warriors that were wrapped in funeral linens and embalmed to prevent decay. Many of the oldest civilisations of Humans, most notably those of Araby and the great southern empire of Nehekhara, interred their dead in such fashion. With the rise of the Great Necromancer Nagash and his cursed art, many of these preserved dead were disturbed from their rest and animated. The Dread King uses many of these Nehekharan warriors in his ranks, as there is a ready supply of them in the Lands of the Dead. Unlike the more mindless Undead, such as Skeletons and Zombies, Mummies always have a will of their own. They swiftly crush anything that stirs them from their sleep before returning to their tomb. There are a few, though, that retain the agendas they had in life, which can make them terrible foes. They are usually armed as they were in life. Weapons and armour that have survived untarnished down the long ages with a Mummy are doubtless magical.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_tomb_guardian	The Royal Guards are the Dread King‘s personal guard. They are exceptional warriors, maintaining all the discipline and martial skill they had in life. In battle, the Royal Guard form unwavering ranks of armoured warriors. They have spilled the blood of their enemies for countless centuries, and numerous armies have been dashed against their implacable shield wall. Enhanced by necromanctic powers, Royal Guards retain more of their former personalities than the massed soldiery of Skeleton Warriors. They awaken with memories of heroic deeds, bloody victories and the unyielding will to destroy their king's enemies still burning strongly in their mind. Above all they remember their duty to protect the Dread King from harm, and any that threaten their charge are slain, cut down without pause.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_tomb_guardian_great_weapons	The Royal Guards are the Dread King‘s personal guard. They are exceptional warriors, maintaining all the discipline and martial skill they had in life. In battle, the Royal Guard form unwavering ranks of armoured warriors. They have spilled the blood of their enemies for countless centuries, and numerous armies have been dashed against their implacable shield wall. Enhanced by necromanctic powers, Royal Guards retain more of their former personalities than the massed soldiery of Skeleton Warriors. They awaken with memories of heroic deeds, bloody victories and the unyielding will to destroy their king's enemies still burning strongly in their mind. Above all they remember their duty to protect the Dread King from harm, and any that threaten their charge are slain, cut down without pause.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_tomb_guardian_peltasts	The Royal Guards are the Dread King‘s personal guard. They are exceptional warriors, maintaining all the discipline and martial skill they had in life. In battle, the Royal Guard form unwavering ranks of armoured warriors. They have spilled the blood of their enemies for countless centuries, and numerous armies have been dashed against their implacable shield wall. Enhanced by necromanctic powers, Royal Guards retain more of their former personalities than the massed soldiery of Skeleton Warriors. They awaken with memories of heroic deeds, bloody victories and the unyielding will to destroy their king's enemies still burning strongly in their mind. Above all they remember their duty to protect the Dread King from harm, and any that threaten their charge are slain, cut down without pause.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_cav_royal_guard_cavalry	In the ranks of the Royal Guard there are also mounted units that accompany their king on his endeavors. In battle, they serve as heavy cavalrymen and usually stay close to the Dread King. A frequently used tactic is to attack the enemy flanks when the opposing army is held in check by the phalanxes. Their onslaught is devastating, the thundering hooves of the Skeletal Steeds crushing flesh and bone beneath them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_cav_royal_guard_lancers	In the ranks of the Royal Guard there are also mounted units that accompany their king on his endeavors. In battle, they serve as heavy cavalrymen and usually stay close to the Dread King. A frequently used tactic is to attack the enemy flanks when the opposing army is held in check by the phalanxes. Their onslaught is devastating, the thundering hooves of the Skeletal Steeds crushing flesh and bone beneath them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_mon_skeleton_elephant	Elephants are exotic creatures hailing from the lush bushlands that lie between Araby and the jungles of the Southlands. The ferocious and dangerous animals have a convenient habit of instinctively directing themselves to specific places to die when they reach a certain age. These elephant graveyards are a treasure trove for any Necromancer, who can find countless corpses there for reanimation. The henchmen of the Dread King control many of these places, securing a steady supply of war beasts. Occasionally, an Arabyan War Elephant finds its way into the Legions of Terror, at least what remains of it after a battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_mon_skeleton_giant	Giants are solitary creatures that tend to wander the lands, settling for short periods of time when they find a rich food source. The nomadic race can be found in many locations within the Old World, terrorising the countryside of Human kingdoms and eating many of its peaceful inhabitants. A Giant can consume an entire herd of livestock in a sitting, and will devastate any village he comes across, pulling out and eating anything he can find amidst the stomped and splintered structures. Sometimes the best way to stop a Giant eating all your livestock is to pay it to join your army. Therefore, many of the ancient kingdoms and city-states of the Black Peninsula recruited them to fight their enemies instead of wasting valuable troops on killing the colossi, as they were then called. The large brutes were equipped with huge armor and weapons to make them even more deadly in battle. Many of these behemoths fight in the Legions of the Dread King to this day, though their flesh rotted away centuries ago.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_mon_skeletal_minotaurs	Minotaurs are the keepers of dark shrines to Chaos and the tombs of fallen champions deep within the farthest reaches of the forests, where even Beastmen fear to tread. Here they pile all of their trophies, including the weapons, armour and skulls of defeated foes in praise of the Chaos gods, often in such quantities that the mounds of rusting treasure and foetid remains obscure the shrines they are actually guarding completely. Many heroes of antiquity set out to kill them in order to cleanse the earth of their presence, but not all survived their quest. The corpses of those beasts that met their end at the blade of a worthy champion are of great value to a Necromancer, for the remains of these savage beasts make for powerful servants.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_art_bone_throwers	Bone Throwers are large versions of crossbows, able to fire huge sharpened thigh bones over a long distance. Reliable and accurate, some have been in service for many thousands of years yet can still bring down any large foe. These war machines are a common sight amongst the armies of the Dread King.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_art_screaming_skull_ballista	These war machines are akin to the catapults of the Tomb Kings armies, but use technology developed in the ancient Old World. The machines use two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from sinew, giving incredible power for its size. However, the Dread King adopted the flaming skull projectiles his enemies use. The Corrupted Priests cast terrible curses upon every one of these skulls, enchanting them so that they scream hideously as they are hurled through the air, rising to a deafening crescendo just before they strike their target. Those are the very death screams of the skulls' former owners, the wailing shrieks of those slaughtered on the field of battle and the agonised cries of prisoners captured at the moment of their execution. Many battle-hardened warriors are driven to the edge of insanity by the blood-curdling sound. This horrific ammunition bursts into hellish, ethereal flames when it is launched, and as the skulls arc through the air, they blaze an eerie trail of green-fire behind them. Most of these skulls explode on impact, sending fragments of splintered bone in all directions and engulfing those nearby in a wash of balefire. Others smash into their target with horrifying force, infernal flames spilling out of empty eye sockets as the skulls chew through armour and warm flesh alike.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_brigands_ror	At the behest of his master, Gunther Larenscheld had hired a group of bandits to stop the mercenary company of the Grudgebringers. They ambushed the mercenaries on their way to Bogenhafen, but were unable to stop them. After the skirmish, the surviving brigands retreated with Larenscheld. Since then they have been in his service and are used whenever a more subtle approach is required.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_wights_ror	The pyramid tomb of the Dread King is full of many labyrinths that are deadly traps for any mortal. Among the many dangers inside are powerful Wights that patrol the dark corridors. They approach shambling from the darkness and their swooping great axe is often the last thing many intruders see. However, at the behest of the Dread King, the Wights also go into battle where they form fearsome shock troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_catacomb_guardians_ror	The Dread King summoned his most trusted guards of honour many aeons ago and bound them to him in oaths so terrible that they can never be spoken aloud again. These baleful servants swore to protect their master even after death, while he slept the long sleep down the years. Even now, these skeletal warriors stand guard over the Catacombs of Terror, the inner sanctum of the Twisted Spire, where his throne room is located. They are given life by much more powerful magic than ordinary Undead and retain a lot of their malign intelligence and wits. Armed with halberds of the highest quality and clad in ancient, ornate armour, there are few who can best them in combat.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_mummies_ror	Many millennia ago, the Dread King invaded Nehekhara to conquer the fertile lands of the Mortis Delta. His legions were vast, but still he was outnumbered in this foreign land. So it came to pass that he recruited native warriors to his cause. These Kleruchoi were given farmland in exchange for military service in the ranks of the Dread King. To this day, they now serve their master, bound by dark magic. All that remains of the once fertile land though is inhospitable desert.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_cav_black_grail_knights_ror	Even in the Dukedom of the Damned, only a being of immense power could hope to usurp the natural order of the Lady of the Lake. That being was the ancient Dread King. Upon his awakening, a great blast of necromantic energy erupted from his pyramid in Nehekhara. Spreading across the Old World, it caused the dead to lurch from their graves, plaguing the Empire, Kislev and beyond. In the tainted realm of Mousillon, the saintly remains of Bretonnia's Grail Knights rose from their tombs, deceived into leading the Liche’s unholy crusade. Taking up their fortress in Castle Mousillon, the Black Grail Knights would become legendary. A blasphemous creation, warped into a dark mockery of their former selves, they were extremely powerful warriors who fought relentlessly. Mounted atop the animated remains of their once noble Bretonnian Warhorses, they could not be slowed by difficult terrain and would never retreat from combat. An aura of fear surrounded them at all times, causing enemies to panic and flee in their wake. So deadly were the warriors, that some did not even know they were knights, believing instead that the Black Grail was an artefact of immense power and destruction. Many tried to defeat the Undead knightly order, and all failed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_mon_skeleton_elephant_ror	In ancient times there was an oracle on the Black Peninsula that was visited by people from near and far to get insights about the future. There, in the temple of Pythos, sat a prophesying priest who was famous for his prophecies, which always came true. Before each divination, an animal was burned as an offering to the gods. After that, those seeking advice could ask their questions to the oracle. One fateful day, the Dread King visited the oracle with his entourage. During his audience he asked the priest how his kingdom would develop under his rule. He did not like the answer he received, however, because the oracle foresaw the darkness into which he would plunge the lands. Being called a tyrant, an unbridled rage inflamed the Dread King. He thrust the priest into the fire of the sacrificial altar and laughed mockingly as he burned in agony. It is said that his death cries can still be heard in the now decayed temple. The other people seeking advice froze in fear and horror as they watched the Dread King resurrect the oracle with his necromantic powers. The prophecy came true and the reign of terror of the Dread King lasts until today. The animated remains of the Oracle of Pythos have served the Dark Lord ever since. When it marches at the head of the legions, the battle is under a good omen. However, instead of animals, since then humans burn in the Balefire of the altar, which gives strength to the Undead warriors.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_dread_corrupted_priest	In the ancient temples of the Black Peninsula, numerous priests served the many gods. They formed different cults and each of them had its own rites and customs. These men preserved ancient knowledge that was passed down from generation to generation. In addition, they were very skilled in the use of the Winds of Magic. People respected the wisdom of the priests and often sought their advice and the blessings of the gods. One day, however, after the Dread King came to power, the ancient lands plunged into darkness. Many of the priests opposed the rise of the Dread King, but there were also those who were blinded by their lust for power. It was easy for the Dread King to draw them to his side with his promises. These corrupted priests still serve him today, spreading his power and influence throughout the world.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_dread_hellwraith	Hellwraiths are the ancient spirits of great necromancers who experimented with the blackest magic in order to acquire immortality - and failed, leaving only an echo of their identity on the Winds of Dhar they manipulated. To come so close to their goal yet be denied drives them instantly insane and fills them with an unimaginable hatred for the living, whose souls they take great pleasure in draining away. To even behold a Hellwraith can be enough to scare a mortal to death. As spirits, they are all also invisible to the naked eye and immune to mundane weapons. They can pass through all barriers and fly across the land at incredible speeds. They can thus single-handedly devastate any armies who have not already fled in terror.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_mon_bone_hydra	Hydras are rampaging and voracious monsters. No matter how much they consume, they seem to always be hungry for more. Their presence will swiftly level most natural surroundings, reducing them to barren waste within a month or so of their taking up residence, which forces them to move on or starve. While Hydras are mighty beasts, their continual destruction of their local environment inevitably leads to their death as more and more enemies oppose them. There are but a scant few Hydras left in the Old World outside of the Chaos Wastes and of those, perhaps only one or two still live within the borders of the Empire. However, this was not always the case, and in ancient times they were fairly common. Because of their destructive nature, even the most bitter enemies banded together to rid their lands of their existence. The bones of those slain beasts can be found in many caves of the Old World. Only a powerful Necromancer, however, can bring them back to life. A reanimated Bone Hydra retains its unnatural regeneration and savagery, making it the ultimate weapon for any Undead host.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_spartan_ror	These legendary warriors are famous for the heroic sacrifice they made. Even today, their deeds serve as an example to many soldiers in the face of almost certain death. Many centuries ago, a giant Waaagh invaded the human kingdoms of the present-day Border Princes. To halt their advance into the Black Peninsula, the Indomitable faced them in a narrow pass. Although they were hopelessly outnumbered and had no chance of victory, they did not flee but faced the horde of Greenskins. For three days they held the Waaagh at bay before they were finally overrun. Sneaky Night Goblins had found tunnels through which they could attack the stalwart defenders from behind. The proud warriors were massacred to the last man, but their sacrifice gave the remaining armies time to regroup and drive the Waaagh away. Even in Undeath, the memory of their last stand and their steadfastness remains with the Indomitable.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_inf_thessos_ror	From the ancient city of Thessos came a troop of select soldiers, consisting of pairs of male lovers. The idea was that the soldiers would fight much harder to protect their beloved and avenge their fallen. The regiment was very successful and helped their city-state to dominance. This came to an abrupt end when they went to battle against the legions of the Dread King. They could not stand against their Undead opponents and the entire unit was wiped out. The Dread King then bound the souls of the fallen warriors and subjected them to his will. He delighted in making the former pride of Thessos, now mere will-less shades of themselves, burn down their hometown. Bound forever, they are to this day a memorial to what awaits those who oppose the Dread King.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_cav_ephalian_ror	Ephalian heavy cavalry were a highly disciplined, mobile and esteemed cavalry unit in antiquity. The famous horsemen often offered their services as mercenaries and could be found in many armies of the time, if they could afford it. They were armed with spears and round shields, which made them especially effective against other mounted units. Their mobility came from the Diamond formation they adopted that enabled a unit to turn with cohesion, form up and charge on any of its four points. As such, these skeleton horsemen are a valuable addition to any army they accompany.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_dk_art_polybolos_ror	The Polybolos is a repeating bolt thrower developed from the Ballista and Bone Thrower. A chain mechanism draws, loads and releases bolts from a gravity-fed magazine as quickly as a handle can be turned. Efficient and deadly, it has the greatest rate of fire of all ancient war machines and is rightly feared by enemy forces. The only drawback is the enormous amount of maintenance the weapon requires due to its complex firing mechanism. Therefore, the reliable Bone Thrower is far more common in the Dread King’s legions.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_dread_cha_possessed_hero	Even in ancient times, countless beasts and monsters populated the world. In search of fame and fortune, many bold warriors attempted to slay one of the legendary beasts. Those who succeeded made a name for themselves throughout the lands and were revered as heroes, immortalized by their great deeds. Not everyone, however, was up to the task and many underestimated the ferocious power of the monsters. Their caves and lairs are full of the decaying bones of those who were not strong or cunning enough. The remains are occasionally possessed by spiteful Wraiths who take cruel pleasure in making the fallen heroes fight and die again, only to reawaken them once more. This wicked game goes on until the Wraith loses interest and looks for its next victim.	true
