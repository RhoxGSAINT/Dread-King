cultures_frontend_description_ovn_dk_legions	Nehekhara once stood as a shining beacon of civilisation and human achievement. But this great realm was destroyed through acts of great treachery and powerful sorcery. The living of Nehekhara perished in a single, mournful night, and in their absence, the dead stirred from their graves and claimed the land anew.\\n\\nEven as their ancient civilisation now lies buried beneath the sand, the Tomb Kings have once more awoken from their deep sleep. Rising from their sarcophagi, the mummified rulers of Nehekhara have returned to reclaim that which is rightfully theirs, their legions innumerable, brandishing weapons of polished bronze and priceless gold. Ancient, emotionless and spiteful to all those who have slighted them, woe betide those foolish enough to stand before their silent onslaught.	true
