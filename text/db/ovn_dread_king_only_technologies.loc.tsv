technologies_onscreen_name_dread_king_tech_hand	The Return of the Hand	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_1_legion	The First Legion has never been known for their strategies or elites - instead they drown the enemies in untold numbers of expandable skeletons.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_2_legion	The Second Legion prefers mobility over all else, employing fast beasts, riders and chariots to terrorize vulnerable targets.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_3_legion	The Third Legion is better prefers combined arms tactics, fielding artillery, skirmishers, cavalry as well as binding souls from long forgotten tombs to hold the frontlines.	false

technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_8	In life, the legions received extensive training, every single one a fearsome warrior. In death, some of these memories still persist.	false

technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_13	The legions often make use of Dire Wolves and Bats to terrorize soft targets.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_14	Long ago a mighty warrior tried to slay a vile Medusa but paid with his life for the attempt. Now a spiteful ghost commands the corpse of the former hero.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_15	Only few mortals are foolish enough to worship Nagash as a god. All of them meet a terrible end eventually, but for some of them their service to Nagash does not end with death.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_16	Resurrected corpses are tireless workers. They need for nothing and will work until their husk fails them. But there are always more to acquire.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_17	What followers of Nagash call a blessing, most would call a curse. Undoubtly there is power to be gained for those willing to pay the price.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_18	The First Companion of the Dread King has followed him loyally and willingly into death - and beyond.	false

technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_25	Even the artillery deployed by the legions is forged from cursed remains of unlucky beings, animated by the malicious intent of a necromancer.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_26	In ancient times, only nobles would ride into battle on a chariot. Now long dead, they still retain a fraction of their superior training.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_27	Long ago, these javelins were used to hunt Elephants or Giant Vultures of the deserts. 	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_28	Those with superior speed and maneuverability dictate the time and place of engagements. This means being faster than your enemy is paramount for success.	false

technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_49	Once a famous hero entered a labyrinth to slay a small group of minotaurs. He very nearly succeeded, but the leader of the minotaurs struck him down. Now his corpse is puppeteered by a vengeful spirit.	false
technologies_short_description_dread_king_tech_50	One champion can be worth hundreds of lesser soldiers. Therefore the talentless must serve as steppingstones to further the strength and development of the talented.	false
